You Have 6 Lives.
If You Guess Incorrectly, Your Live Count Will Keep Decreasing Till It Reaches Zero.
Once It Reaches 0, You're Dead.

However, If You Guess A "Letter" Correctly In A "Chosen Word" Then The Blank Will Be Replaced With The Actual Letter.
If There Are No Blanks Left, Then You Won.

Enjoy ~
